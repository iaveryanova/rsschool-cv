### Briefly About Myself:
My background is chemistry. I graduated Belarussian State University. I worked for a pharmaceutical company. I was a Regulatory Affairs Manager. My role was related to preparing different documents for quality control of medicines. And I am grateful for the experience and knowledge that I have gained. But I have long been interested in the topic of software development. For myself, I chose Front-end development. Because I like to immediately see the result of my work. 
I have experience in development of web pages using HTML, CSS/SCSS (cross-browser adaptive and semantic layout). I have learned JavaScript while developing the client side of a web application. I have implemented applications on React and Angular using JavaScript/TypeScript.
Seeking a full-time position  in a company with a modern approach to development and a collaborative team. Planning to improve my skills in front-end deeper.
